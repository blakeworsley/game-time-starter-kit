# Game Time Project: Surf's Up

[Play the game] (https://blakeworsley.github.io/surfs-up/)

## Description

Surf's Up in Javascript and HTML5 canvas. This game was built by Blake Worsley and MaryJane Valade as a paired project in Module 1 of the Turing School's Front-End Engineering program.

The goal of this project was to use all the skills we've learned so far to build a simple game that was playable and looked good in the browser.

We used the Google Chrome dinosaur game as inspiration to create Surf's Up. Players manipulate a surfer using the spacebar to jump over rocks.

## Installation
Clone repository and install dependencies:  
```
git clone git@github.com:blakeworsley/surfs-up.git  
cd surfs-up
npm install
```
To fire up a development server:

```
npm start
```

Once the server is running, you can visit:

* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/` to run your application.
* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/test.html` to run your test suite in the browser.

To build the static files:

```js
npm run build
```


To run tests in Node:

```js
npm test
```  

## Insight
We decided to build a variation of the Chrome dinosaur game to stretch our Javascript abilities and better understand the Chai testing system.
